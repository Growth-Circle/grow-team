# The sanji API

sanji uses the compatible sanji API protocol. These APIs allow you to
integrate other services with sanji. This
guide should help you find the API you need:

* First, check if the tool you'd like to integrate with sanji
  [already has a native integration](/integrations/).
* Next, check if [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps) or
  [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/search) has an integration.
  native integrations can often connect a service without writing code.
* If you'd like to send content into sanji, you can
  [write a native incoming webhook integration][incoming-webhooks-overview]
  or use the [API for sending messages](/api/send-message).
* If you're building an interactive bot that reacts to activity inside
  sanji, see the
  [Python framework for interactive bots](/help/running-bots) or
  [real-time events API](/api/get-events).

To build your own sanji integration, check out
the full [REST API](/api/rest), generally starting with
[installing the API client bindings](/api/installation-instructions).

In case you already know how you want to build your integration and you're
just looking for an API key, we've got you covered [here](/api/api-keys).
